handle indianness
There is no reason to unpack the data in gather
	pass reference and offset

Error splice() offset past end of array at /devel/perl_modules/Data/HexDump/Range/blib/lib/Data/HexDump/Range.pm line 1579.
	due to bitfield offset after the data it works on


rename show_* options to display_* 

html file, that is the web site, in the distribution
	pod with embedded HTML dumps
		man page ?
	embed the html in the module directly
	many examples of module and hdr usage
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-record
		IPV4 header

format can use the same code is colorizer is specialized for the html

	mail pod people to get an ansi color tag A<blue on yellow> this text A<reset>


support bitfields

Add a comment element to the range description
	dump it last

handle stdin via <> magic

option 
	show ranges legend before dump
		sub to only return the legend is public (see S-record above))
		how does it work with gather?
	
	interval for showing
		columns and rulers
	display the ranges as data structure (DTD, DD)
	to not show comments
		=> zero size works right now
	allow user to define colors in a file that is passed as argument to hdr

in direct dump mode, use the offset passed by the user to set the starting offset point
	000017 xx xx xx xx                    something starting at offset 17

if single item range is sub and the returned data is an array ref, expand the ref

in vertical and horizontal examples
	show the name of the columns
	use asciio for some examples

simple hdr example in module documentation

pack format
	can we get the size of the data defined by pack?
	use Scalar::Util qw(looks_like_number);
	variable format

Data::hexDump::Table
	see IPV4 example on wikipedia

Test::Hexdump::Range
	alway use ANSI or ascii. or direct to file and accept any format
	not user settable color (we cycle)
	different bytes are displayed with red background
		how do we tell DHR to change the color of only a few bytes within a range
			./Build ; perl -Mblib scripts/hdr Todo.txt  -r 'header,40, yellow:padding,16:magic,16,red:size,4:data,10:data_got,10,on_red:data,80:footer,16'
			./Build ; perl -Mblib scripts/hdr Todo.txt  -r 'header,40, yellow:padding,16:magic,16,red:size,4:data,10:data_exp,10,black on_green:data,80:footer,16'

	cyclic colors must contain OK and error colors
	user settable number of ranges to dispay after and before the diff in the binary data
	side by side comparizon in vertical mode
