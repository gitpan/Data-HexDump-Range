error
	in horizontal format cycle colors should not change before range is changed

	comment and zero size  show when -show_range_name 0
	
html file, that is the web site, in the distribution
	pod with embedded HTML dumps
	embed the html in the module directly
	many examples of module and hdr usage
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-record

support bitfields
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_Header#Header
	maybe a hexdump that dumps in table format is a good idea

handle stdin via <> magic

option 
	show ranges legend before dump
		sub to only return the legend is public (see S-record above))
		how does it work with gather?
	show ruler above dumps
	interval for showing
		columns and rulers
	display the ranges as data structure (DTD, DD)
	to not show comments
		=> zero size works right now
	allow user to define colors in a file that is passed as argument to hdr
	max dump size for hdr
	dump as source for copying in C source code

in direct dump mode, use the offset passed by the user to set the starting offset point
	000017 xx xx xx xx                    something starting at offset 17

if single item range is sub and the returned data is an array ref, expand the ref

in vertical and horizontal examples
	show the name of the columns
	use asciio for some examples

simple hdr example in module documentation

pack format
	can we get the size of the data defined by pack?
	use Scalar::Util qw(looks_like_number);
	variable format

Test::Hexdump::Range
	alway use ANSI or ascii. or direct to file and accept any format
	not user settable color (we cycle)
	different bytes are displayed with red background
		how do we tell DHR to change the color of only a few bytes within a range
			./Build ; perl -Mblib scripts/hdr Todo.txt  -r 'header,40, yellow:padding,16:magic,16,red:size,4:data,10:data_got,10,on_red:data,80:footer,16'
			./Build ; perl -Mblib scripts/hdr Todo.txt  -r 'header,40, yellow:padding,16:magic,16,red:size,4:data,10:data_exp,10,black on_green:data,80:footer,16'

	cyclic colors must contain OK and error colors
	user settable number of ranges to dispay after and before the diff in the binary data
	side by side comparizon in vertical mode
