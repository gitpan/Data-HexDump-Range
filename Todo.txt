Rewind command
	allows to see the same data in different way
		Easy to implement but what are the use cases?

range error location is not very helpful as the location is the line where the object is defined not the line where the array is defined. It also doesn't help much to know that a structure with tens of lines failed, it would be good to pinpoint a location in the array.

	do not accept '::' as a valid range

	dump the whole range definition with DTD
		colorize the failing range
		colorize all ranges that would fail ?

	Text::Context
	PBS::Output::GetLineWithContext
	Carp::source


tests
	Can we get to Error: too few elements in range description 
	\&parser vs [\&parser]


MSB/LSB
	shouldn't we use b* when bit 0 is on the right

refactoring
	do not cary a copy of the data in the ranges
	type instead for IS_COMMENT, IS_BITFIELD, IS_SKIP
	split should use $self->{FIELD_LENGTH}
	author tests
	spelling
	skip range code
	bitfield column display code
		cleaner
		more effective
	data flow and architectural overview
		specially for complex ranges
	remove ugly goto
