refactoring
	do not cary the data in the ranges
	type instead for IS_COMMENT, IS_BITFIELD, IS_SKIP
	split should use $self->{FIELD_LENGTH}
	author tests
	spelling
	skip range code
	bitfield column display code
		cleaner
		more effective

examples
	IPV4 header

# --------------------------------------------------------
# IPV4_header:
# BF: Version 4, Header length 4, Differentiated Services 2, Total Length 30
# BF: Identification 16, Flags 2,	Fragment Offset 30
# BF: Time to Live 8, Protocol 8, Header Checksum 16
# BF: source Address 32

# if Header Length > 5 
# 	data 192+

#
# 			display extra info about the bit fields(done through a
# 			range sub) (this could also be done for any range)
# 			 
# 			 Differentiated Services (DS) 
# 			 # bit 3: 0 = Normal Delay, 1 = Low Delay
# 			 # bit 4: 0 = Normal Throughput, 1 = High Throughput
# 			 # bit 5: 0 = Normal Reliability, 1 = High Reliability
# 			 # bit 6: 0 = Normal Cost, 1 = Minimize Monetary Cost
# 			 (defined by RFC 1349)
